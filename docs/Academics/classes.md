# Recommended Classes

A list of recommended classes by former students. If you would like to add/update this list, send a [pull request](https://github.com/BUGS-NYU/nyu-cs-wiki/pulls)!

## CAS
- Applied Internet Technology (CSCI-UA 0467)
  
  Course Description: Applied Internet Technology is a practical introduction to creating modern web applications. It covers full-stack (that is, every aspect of building a database driven web application: server programming, database implementation, frontend markup, styling and interactivity) web development. It includes topics such as database and data model design, web application architecture, separation of logic and presentation, handling user input and processing form data, managing asynchronous processes, strategies for creating real-time web applications, and handling client-side interactivity. Students will use current server and client-side web frameworks and libraries to build dynamic, data-driven sites. Various applications to support development will also be introduced, such as version control, static analysis tools, and build systems.

  Comment: This class, in my opinion, is one of the most useful electives you can take.  Professor Versoza caters the course to modern conventions so the course is always evolving.  The homeworks are time consuming but all very doable within the allocated time.  This class helps build a strong foundation of practical skills for a career in web development.  
## Tandon

- Algorithmic Machine Learning and Data Science (CS-UY 3943B)
  
  Course Description: This course gives a behind-the-scenes look into the algorithms and computational methods that make machine learning and data science work at large scale. How does a service like Shazam match a sound clip to a library of 10 million songs in under a second? How do scientists find patterns in terabytes of genetic data? How can we efficiently train neural networks with billions of parameters on terabytes of data? We will address these questions and others by studying advanced algorithmic techniques like randomization, approximation, sketching, continuous optimization, spectral methods, and Fourier methods.

  Comment: I really enjoyed the applied mathematics and proofs in a machine learning context. However, be forewarned that this is a very difficult Tandon course; you should have few to no difficult other classes in the same semester. 

  Prerequisities: Previous course in machine learning (CS-UY 4563, CS-GY 6923...), previous course in algorithm design and analysis, linear algebra.  Some experience with probability and random variables expected.

- Intro to Offensive Security (CS-UY 3943)

  Course Description: The purpose of this course is to teach the offensive side of cybersecurity, namely attacks. We will learn about and implement attacks for vulnerabilities in web applications and C/C++ binary programs (including bypasses for common exploit mitigations), learn how to reverse engineer assembly code, and break flawed cryptographic implementations.

  Comment: This class is a great introductory to Offensive Security Tools and methods in use by [penetration testers](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-penetration-testing.html) and [hackers](https://cyberonline.sdsu.edu/blog/penetration-testing-vs-ethical-hacking/) in today's world. This is done through the use of Jeopardy Style [Capture-The-Flag competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) where 100% of the grade is evaluated on the effectiveness of student's system breaches.

  Prerequisites: None (Though some experience in python scripting is expected.)
